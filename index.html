    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>
    	My name is Dylan Dy (or Dylan-Matthew Garza). 
	I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
    In terms of technologies, I am very interested in Linux, embedded Linux, programming (systems, embedded, firmware,
    and occassionally web). I also enjoy teaching those mentioned interests to people and sharing what I know about
    them.     
    </p>
    <p>
    Other than that, my main "hobby" is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting">
    Olympic Weightlifting</a> (also known just as Weightlifting), which should <strong>not</strong>
    be confused with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerlifting">powerlifting</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilding">bodybuilding</a>, or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossFit">CrossFit</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Software I enjoy</h2>
    </p>
    A brief summary of some tools I enjoy using and working with:
    </br > </br>
      <li><a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>(currently as daily driver),
          <a href="https://artixlinux.org/">Artix Linux</a>, and 
	  <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>.</li>
      <li> <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>/<a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and recently
	      <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim">nixvim</a> (neovim configured by nix modules) <s>since
		      terminal-based text editors are for <strong>serious</strong> software developers.</s></li>
      <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(software)">ed</a>: The early text editor that was used to write the 
	      C programming language and UNIX. Only <strong>REAL</strong> engineers use this one. Despite no code-completion,
	      integrated debugger, syntax highlighting/checking, it was used to write 2 very relevant technologies of today.
	      Just a parallel to common modern development environments and the people who use them :-)
      <li><a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> (tiling window manager)
	       but nowadays to be future-proof by using <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>, 
	       I now use <a href="https://hyprland.org/">hyprland</a> (with dwm-like bindings and behavior).</li>
      <li> <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> is pretty neat. </li>
      <li> <a href="https://github.com/elkowar/eww">eww widgets</a>, which is a widget system that allows you to define your own
                    GTK windows as widgets with its own language which use s-expressions. Similar to other s-expression languages like
                    like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp family</a> of languages,
                    it has a built-in feature of metaprogramming with using "literals" which call some other program to dynamically
                    update itself.</li>
      <li> <a href="https://harelang.org/">Hare Programming Language</a>: A C-like systems programming language. I really just like the Hare mascot.
    </p>
    <h2> Projects </h2>
    These are some projects I am pretty happy about/proud of. 
    </br></br>

	    <ul>
		    <li> I aim this project to replace httpd/apache that hosts this website so I can HOPEFULY have
			    more defined control of connections thats "easier" for me to manage instead of 
			    figuring out how to configure httpd/apache. Still early in development (as of February 28).
		    </li>
		    <li> A big challenge will be implementing SSL/TLS with 
			    <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">openssl</a> as I have not had
			    any experience doing so.

    <li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/epic-bar-rs">Custom Status Bar in Rust with GTK4</a>
	    <details>
		    <summary>Click to view more details</summary>
		I wanted to implement my own status bar and not rely on as much abstractions as the Eww widgets bar. 
		This status bar is implemented with GTK4 using the Rust bindings as well as the GTK4-layer-shell rust
		bindings since this is primarily running on the Hyprland compositor. I plan to one day port it to dwm 
		with dwm's IPC patch. I port over a lot of the rust code I used for the implementation in the Eww widget
		bar to this. Luckily the language Eww widgets used was very similar to the relationship to how GTK objects
		behave.

		<ul>

			<li> This is my daily status-bar I use on my main machine.
			</li>
			<li> Reads and writes to <a href="https://wiki.hyprland.org/IPC/">Hyprland's IPC UNIX Sockets</a>
				to check for workspace/client events to update widgets and to respond to click handlers
				to switch to workspace/client.
			</li>
			<li> Uses seperate thread to periodically check for events to prevent blocking of GKT events (mouse events)
				and uses Rust's 
				<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html">mpsc channels</a>
				to communicate back to main thread if events occur so widgets can be updated.
			</li>
			<li> Obtains average CPU Load from <div class="code">/stat/proc</div> by sampling every second and calculating
				the deltas between readings determining what percentage of the aggregate CPU time was spent in
				idle states (<div class="code">idle</div> and <div class="code">irq</div>) vs non-idle states.
			</li>
			<li> Obtains CPU frequency by reading the current CPUs' speed under 
				<div class="code">/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq</div>
				by opening each file in parallel with a thread handle and summing each frequency and dividing by
				the number of CPUs (cores).
			</li>
			<li> Now contains a <div class="code">flake.nix</div> and 
				<div class="code">flake.lock</div> for reproducibility for systems that use Nix.
				Using <a href="https://github.com/edolstra/flake-compat">flake-compat</a> for
				systems that have not yet started using the flake feature. 
			</li>

	    utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/elkowar/eww">
          Eww</a> widget system. The bar does not use <em>any</em> silly, slow scripts to obtain system
  information. It instead uses <em>compiled</em> binaries written in <em>real</em> programming languages meant for 
  creating useful software. The compiled binaries dynamically generate the s-expressions for eww to generate 
  the widgets with realtime information. The different ones I have written:
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/eww-workspaces">eww-workspaces</a>: dynamically shows workspace numbers
		as clickable buttons, allowing for differentiation between the active one and the open ones. </li>
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/eww-windows">eww-windows</a>: dynamically shows open windows across 
		open workspaces, while listing workspaces by most recently used (clickable with icons!).
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/statuses-rs">statuses(in rust)</a>: Shows SSID, WiFi connection strength,
		and ram usage.</li>
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/statuses">statuses(in C)</a>: Shows battery, time, and date.</li>

      </ul>

		 using STM32MP157F-DK2 with custom layer.
	    <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/meta-zf-project">here</a>. Built/ installed other software I wrote 
	    for the project. Uses custom generated device tree from STM32CubeMx and patched stm32mp1 Linux kernel
	    device tree. Also used a custom defconfig for loading necessary kernel modules.

	<li> <strong>WebAssembly (WASM) application written in Rust</strong>
				using the <a href="https://yew.rs/">Yew framework</a>.
		(link to the repo <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/zf-yew-app">here</a>) Simple user interface
		for device testers to interact with to see real time results and remotely test devices.

	<li> <strong>Custom API application server written in Rust</strong>
		,meant to interact with server to load ARM Cortex-M4 firmware
		and communicate to firmware regarding the state of the test, results, and recoreded realtime data
		saved to the kernel trace buffer. 
		(link to repo <a href="https://github.com/DMGDy/zf-webserver-app">here</a>. Used the
		<a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">warp web server framework</a>, which is a minimal

    <li> <strong> Microcontroller (ARM M4) Firmware </strong> created communication system between firmware and the

                  using the <a href="https://www.openampproject.org/">OpenAMP Project</a> to communicate over virtual UART.
                  Communication consisted of status of loading the firmware, confirmation of necessary information for the test,
                  and test progress. Also contributed to the debugging and development of the firmware that would test devices
                  and was responsible for porting the necessary RCC configurations to the appropiate DeviceTree so that Linux
                  may configure the system clock the same way the standalone firmware would on the STM32MP157F-DK2.
